# Phases for my work
1. **Research and proof of concept phase:** What/when/how to build security tools; assess tooling ecosystem; identify gaps
2. **Build out phase** build high quality tools and high impact shareable components, coordination and tracking
3. **Hardening** hunt bugs and patch, coordination and tracking
