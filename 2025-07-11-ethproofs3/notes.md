Yeah so I am a recent EF joiner working on security of ZKVMs. In these early days I have been doing research on
 - The current state of security
 - The relevant security tooling ecosystem
I've been doing this by building proofs of concepts and talking to people. 

Goals of PoC phase:
 - Identify what we should build and run and when we should do so. 
 - Look for gaps we can fill.
 - Identify high-impact tooling components we build to support external efforts.
Medium term:
 - Build some high-quality tools.
 - Coordination
Longer term I see myself
 - Bug hunting and patching bugs 
 - Possibly coordinating security efforts with external teams.

What I've done so far (plan to write some of this up for public consumption):
 - Running RISC-V architecture tests
 - Building simple RISC-V emulator fuzzer
 - Just started: Plonky3 verifier fuzzing


Closing:
 - Very exciting time to work in this space.
 - Thanks for your great work.
 - My door is open.
